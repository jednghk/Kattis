Hi friends, this is a repo containing my solutions to various problems on Kattis.

I've organised the repo by the difficulty as defined by Kattis and I have provided the links to the problems on Kattis itself.

If you have any suggestions to improve the organisation or readability of my code do drop me a message. Of course,
if you'd like help with a specific problem or would like an explanation on how I solved it, you can message me as well.
